    <p>
      I just completed the U of M coding bootcamp to learn to be a full stack
      developer. I have worked for software companies doing technical support,
      client training, and project coordination. I am also a trained track &
      field coach, massage therapist, and yoga instructor. I enjoy helping
      others achieve their goals.
