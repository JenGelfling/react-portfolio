    <p>
      I recently completed the University of Minnesota coding bootcamp, where I
      trained to become a full stack developer using the MERN stack â€” MongoDB,
      Express.js, React, and Node.js. While I've previously worked with HTML,
      CSS, and some SQL, this bootcamp allowed me to build applications from
      front end to back end for the first time.

      My professional background includes experience in technical support,
      client training, and project coordination within software companies. I
      also have the rewarding experience of tutoring a student in C# to develop
      a game in Unity, which further deepens my understanding of programming and
      game design. Additionally, I am or have been, a certified track & field
      coach, massage therapist, and yoga instructor, all of which reflect my
      passion for helping others achieve their goals.
